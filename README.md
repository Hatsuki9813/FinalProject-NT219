# About
This is my final project for NT219 course, the main idea is about a video streaming platform which support video's encryption
while transmittin  and storing on server . <br />
User can request a video from server, and that video will be played through a secure channel using HLS <br />
User ( with content creator's account ) can also upload a video, that video will be saved on server in an encrypted format ( AES )
# Dependencies
opencv, pyqt6, pymysql
# Server setup
I use a Linux virtual machine as a server for this project, MySQL to create a database, and Flask to handle user's request
